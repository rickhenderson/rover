# rover
Python Code and other info for a 4 wheeled robot controlled by a Raspberry Pi.

I'm new to robotics and Python, but not to computers and programming. I'm definitely learning a lot.
October 29, 2015: Rover now uses `move2.py` to move forward and backward 2 seconds using 4 wheels. An improvement over `move.py`
which is monolithic, move2.py includes functions `moveForward(intTime)` and `moveBackward(intTime)` to move the rover for a 
period of seconds. My first Python functions!
