# Using a servo requires PWM - Pulse Width Modulation
# Required are some calculations re: Duty Cycle which
# have been integrated into the code.

GPIO.setup(7, GPIO.OUT)

# Set up PWM
p = GPIO.PWM(7,50)
p.start(7.5) # Neutral for Gaven's servo 7.5

try:
	while True:

		p.ChangeDutyCycle(7.5)
		time.sleep(1) # Wait for 1 sec
		# Set to 180 degrees
		p.ChangeDutyCycle(12.5)

		# Set to 0 degrees

		p.ChangeDutyCycle(2.5)
		time.sleep(1)

# Keep looping until a key is pressed.
